# 3p98-Final-Project
3p98 term project unity build and project

It is a "3d" asteroid game(the player can move only in 2d). 
- WASD to move.
- Shift to fire.
- You the player find yourself in a weird world of asteroids and planets. Your goal is to survive. 
- You can shoot at enemies(Red asteroids) if you have more than 1000 Mass(energy unit). Your core energy capsule can keep you stable at 1000 units but when you gain mass, the excessive energy is lost due to overheating.
- When a red planet hits your shield you lose some mass.
- When you hit other neutral planets you gain mass.
- Shooting also makes you lose mass and you won't be able to fire if you are at 1000 units. 
- At 1000 units your energy shield is not operable and you are susceptible to enemy hits.
- Enemies can also gain mass if they hit neural planets.

To launch the game extract game.zip and launch the game.exe file.
